# MyAgCFO Image Assets

This directory contains image assets for the MyAgCFO website.

## Required Images

The following background images are referenced in the application and should be added:

### Hero Background Images
- `dairy-background.jpg` - Background image for dairy page hero section
- `cattle-background.jpg` - Background image for cattle page hero section  
- `ranch-background.jpg` - Background image for ranch page hero section

### Recommended Image Specifications
- **Format**: WebP preferred, JPEG as fallback
- **Dimensions**: 1920x1080 minimum for hero backgrounds
- **File Size**: Optimized for web (under 500KB each)
- **Content**: High-quality agricultural photography showing:
  - Dairy: Modern dairy barn with Holstein cattle
  - Cattle: Beef cattle in pasture or feedlot setting
  - Ranch: Diverse ranch landscape with multiple enterprises

### Image Optimization
Consider creating multiple sizes for responsive design:
- `dairy-background-1920x1080.webp` (desktop)
- `dairy-background-1200x675.webp` (tablet)
- `dairy-background-768x432.webp` (mobile)

Repeat for cattle and ranch backgrounds.

## Logo Assets
If a MyAgCFO logo is created, add:
- `MyAgCFO-Logo.svg` - Vector logo for scalability
- `MyAgCFO-Logo.png` - Raster fallback

## Alternative Approach
Until custom images are available, you can:
1. Use stock photography from sites like Unsplash or Pexels
2. Remove background images temporarily and rely on gradient backgrounds
3. Use placeholder images with proper agricultural themes

## Image Attribution
If using stock images, ensure proper licensing and attribution as required.
